    <h4>Why Search Engine Privacy Matters</h4>
    
    <p class="lead">Your search engine knows more about you than most other online services.</p>
    
    <p>Every time you search for information online, your search engine collects data about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What you're interested in</li>
        <li>Problems you're trying to solve</li>
        <li>Personal information you're looking up</li>
        <li>Your location and device information</li>
        <li>The times you're active online</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Major search engines like Google can create detailed profiles of your interests, behaviors, and personal information based solely on your search history.

    <h5>Privacy-Focused Alternatives</h5>
    <p>Consider switching to privacy-respecting search engines that don't track your searches:</p>
